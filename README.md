<h2>Step 3</h2>

- Return to your Google Drive, refresh the page, and locate the file you just created.

- Copy the file's URL, then open a separate browser window in Incognito/Private mode.

- Click the three dots in your browser and choose "New InPrivate window."

- Click the "Share" button on the file, and under General access, select "Anyone with the link", which allows anyone who has the link to view the file.

- Paste the link into the Incognito/Private window, and you should be able to view the file from that private browser.

<h2>Step 4</h2>

- Return to your regular browser and click the "Share" button again. Under access settings, you can change the role to Viewer, Commenter, or Editor.

- When set to Viewer, you can only view the file and see changes as others type.

- When set to commenter, you can view the file and add comments, and the file owner can see your activity.

- When set to editor, you have full control, including editing content, saving changes, or deleting the file.

- Switch back to your Incognito/Private browers-your actions will be limited to the permission level you selected. If you have editor access, try typing in the file to confirm.

<h2>Step 5</h2>

If you don't want your file to be publicly accessible, click "Share" and set General access to Restricted. Then, use the search bar to share the file directly with specific people by entering their email addresses.

For each email recipient, you can choose their permission level-Viewer, commenter, or editor-depending on how much access you want them to have.

Open regular browser, sign in to the email account you shared the file with, locate the file, and try viewing, commenting, or editing it based on the permissions you assigned.
